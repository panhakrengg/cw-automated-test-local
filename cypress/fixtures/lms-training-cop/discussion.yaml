              name: Nice to meet you!
              body: The phrase, "nice to meet you" is very kind but definitely overused. It is a way to express gratitude towards a person and let them know you appreciate their presence. Telling someone, "nice to meet you" is formal but also laid back and easygoing. Create by CoP Admin
